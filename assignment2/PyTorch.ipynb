When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore-input"],"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2sVLMgLak2G1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687747178031,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Jaskanwal Preet Singh Chhabra","userId":"09599718546347013125"}},"outputId":"54cea7bf-e98b-42fa-d50b-24fa2c9b3eb6"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Before flattening:  tensor([[[[ 0,  1],\n","          [ 2,  3],\n","          [ 4,  5]],\n","\n","         [[ 6,  7],\n","          [ 8,  9],\n","          [10, 11]]],\n","\n","\n","        [[[12, 13],\n","          [14, 15],\n","          [16, 17]],\n","\n","         [[18, 19],\n","          [20, 21],\n","          [22, 23]]]])\n","After flattening:  tensor([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11],\n","        [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]])\n"]}],"source":["def flatten(x):\n","    N = x.shape[0] # read in N, C, H, W\n","    return x.view(N, -1)  # \"flatten\" the C * H * W values into a single vector per image\n","\n","def test_flatten():\n","    x = torch.arange(24).view(2, 2, 3, 2)\n","    print('Before flattening: ', x)\n","    print('After flattening: ', flatten(x))\n","\n","test_flatten()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore"],"id":"yPsnfKo0k2G1"},"source":["### Barebones PyTorch: Two-Layer Network\n","\n","Here we define a function `two_layer_fc` which performs the forward pass of a two-layer fully-connected ReLU network on a batch of image data.

When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n","- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n","- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n","  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n","  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n","\n","### Have fun and happy training!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":58,"metadata":{"test":"open_ended_accuracy","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"V-hO87Ick2G7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687753778544,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":270126,"user":{"displayName":"Jaskanwal Preet Singh Chhabra","userId":"09599718546347013125"}},"outputId":"a5e769c4-1d3d-42a1-9d44-823838f79387"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Iteration 0, loss = 2.3962\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 192 / 1000 correct (19.20)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 1.4619\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 518 / 1000 correct (51.80)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.9354\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 615 / 1000 correct (61.50)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.9138\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 658 / 1000 correct (65.80)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.9096\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 687 / 1000 correct (68.70)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.7350\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 676 / 1000 correct (67.60)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.7658\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 693 / 1000 correct (69.30)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.7292\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 710 / 1000 correct (71.00)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.4846\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 733 / 1000 correct (73.30)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.5036\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 717 / 1000 correct (71.70)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.5569\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 740 / 1000 correct (74.00)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.4860\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 746 / 1000 correct (74.60)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.3736\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 754 / 1000 correct (75.40)\n","\n","Iteration 0, loss = 0.3610\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 751 / 1000 correct (75.10)\n","\n"]}],"source":["################################################################################\n","# TODO:                                                                        #\n","# Experiment with any architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters.          #\n","# Achieve AT LEAST 70% accuracy on the *validation set* within 10 epochs.      #\n","#                                                                              #\n","# Note that you can use the check_accuracy function to evaluate on either      #\n","# the test set or the validation set, by passing either loader_test or         #\n","# loader_val as the second argument to check_accuracy.
